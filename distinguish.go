// Distinguish says what each build IS, in the only terms that help: the axes
// on which it differs from the others it is listed beside.
//
// ⛔⛔ A LIST OF HASHES IS UNUSABLE AND THAT IS NOT A PRESENTATION DETAIL. A
// hash is opaque by construction; shown two of them, a reader has no way to
// pick, and the command that printed them has handed over its own problem.
// Nix pays exactly this price — a store path says WHICH build and never WHAT
// build — and the answer everywhere else is to keep the spec queryable:
// `spack find libdwarf +debug`, conda's info/hash_input.json. We publish the
// spec on the manifest for this reason; this is the function that uses it.
//
// ⛔ IT DESCRIBES THE DIFFERENCE, NOT THE BUILD. A full spec is 54
// dependencies, identical in 53 of them, and printing it per row buries the
// one edge that matters in a screen of agreement. What a reader asked is "how
// do these differ", so that is what is answered — the same reason `diff`
// exists rather than printing both files.
//
// The result is parallel to the input: one line per spec, "" for a spec that
// records nothing. A caller must say so rather than printing an empty cell —
// see the note zpkgs prints for a bottle published before identities existed.
