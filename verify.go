// ⛔⛔ RETIRING A KEY MUST NOT INVALIDATE WHAT IT SIGNED. A signature is a
// statement about bytes, made at a moment; replacing the key we sign WITH
// says nothing about the bottles already signed. A trust set that dropped
// the old key would refuse the whole published registry overnight — and
// since the fix for a lost or compromised key is to rotate, a design where
// rotation breaks everything is a design where nobody rotates.
//
// ⛔ AND THEY ARE NOT EXPIRED BY DATE, BECAUSE THERE IS NO DATE TO EXPIRE
// THEM BY. Every published bottle carries the same pinned timestamp so that
// re-publishing is byte-identical, so "was this signed before the key was
// retired?" is a question nothing on the artefact can answer. Pretending
// otherwise would be a check that cannot fail. A key leaves this list only
// when a human decides its signatures are no longer to be believed — which
// is a withdrawal of trust, a different and louder act than rotation.

// ⛔ `go-zpkg-until-2026-11` IS RETIRED, NOT REVOKED, AND THE DISTINCTION IS
// A JUDGEMENT WE MADE RATHER THAN A FACT WE FOUND. Its private half could
// not be located: two scans of the maintainer's workstation covered
// 2,167,120 files and found no key, and what sat in the CI secret turned out
// to be its PUBLIC half. Lost is not compromised — nothing suggests anybody
// else holds it — so everything it signed stays trusted and nothing needs
// rebuilding. If evidence of compromise ever appears, it moves to
// RevokedSigningKeys and that changes.

// RevokedSigningKeys are keys that were OURS and are no longer trusted —

//
// ⛔⛔ REVOKING IS NOT RETIRING, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE POINT OF
// HAVING BOTH. A retired key is one we stopped signing WITH; everything it
// signed is still ours and still true. A revoked key is one somebody else
// may have held, so NOTHING it signed can be distinguished from a forgery —
// including bottles it signed perfectly legitimately before the compromise.
//
// ⛔ AND WE CANNOT TELL THE TWO APART, BECAUSE THERE IS NO DATE. Every
// published bottle carries the same pinned timestamp, so "was this signed
// before the key leaked?" has no answer on the artefact. A scheme that
// honoured signatures made "before" the revocation would be a check that
// cannot fail, which is worse than no check: it would restore trust in
// exactly the artefacts an attacker would plant.
//
// So a revoked key's signature counts for NOTHING — and is reported, loudly
// and separately from a stranger's. A stranger signing our bottle is noise
// anybody can make; our own revoked key on a bottle is a fact about our
// supply chain that the reader has to act on.
//
// The remedy for a revoked key is to rebuild and re-sign, not to argue. That
// is expensive, which is why it is a different list from the retired one and
// why entries carry a reason.
