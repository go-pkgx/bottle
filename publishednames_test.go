// distBaseAtInit is the COMPILED-IN default, captured before any test runs.

// itself, because it depends on it.

// FILE IS THE GATE THAT MAKES A RENAME STOP AND LOOK.
//
// Twice now a repository-wide rename has rewritten one of these and moved
// nothing:
//
//	DistBase            go-pkgx/packages → go-zpkg/packages        (#192)
//	                    five releases pointed the fleet at an empty registry
//	CatalogProjectName  go-pkgx.dev/catalog → go-zpkg.github.io/…  (#192)
//	                    every `catalog update` on defaults failed since
//
// Both were found from the outside, long after release, because nothing in
// the repository could tell the difference between "renamed" and "broken":
// the code compiled, every unit test passed, and the value was wrong.
//
// So the values are written down twice — once where they are used, once here
// — and the second copy carries the reason. A rename pass that rewrites the
// first and not the second fails this test with the paragraph below in front
// of it. That is the whole mechanism, and it is deliberately not clever: the
// point is that the value cannot change SILENTLY, not that this file knows
// which value is right.
//
// To change one for real: copy the artefact first, verify it anonymously
// (`ghcrprobe -ns <org>/<repo> <project> <a-known-present-control>`), then
// change both copies in the same commit and say in the message what the probe
// returned.
