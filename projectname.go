// A project name is a NAME. It is not a path, and it is not a URL fragment.
//
// # WHAT HAPPENED WITHOUT THIS
//
// Every lookup builds a URL by concatenation:
//
//	fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s/%s", base, project, "package.yml")
//
// Go sends the path verbatim — it does not clean `..` out of a request —
// and raw.githubusercontent.com answers a traversing path with a 307 to
// the normalised one, which Go's client follows by default. Measured, not
// reasoned about:
//
//	httpGet(".../pkgxdev/pantry/main/projects/../../../../go-pkgx/pantry-overlay/main/README.md")
//	→ 1270 bytes of ANOTHER REPOSITORY'S file
//
// A recipe is not inert. It declares dependencies, a build script and the
// runtime environment a package exports, so fetching one from a repository
// an attacker chose is the whole game: `bk` would run its build script, and
// `pkgx` would resolve and export whatever it says.
//
// # WHERE THE NAME COMES FROM
//
// Not only from a command line, which is why the command line is not the
// place to check it. A project name arrives in:
//
//	a LOCK file      fetched from a repository and acted on by
//	                 `pkgx --lock` and `bk factory --lock`
//	a CATALOGUE      pulled from a registry, read by `pkgx ls`, `search`
//	                 and every <TAB>
//	a RECIPE's deps  which came from one of the above
//
// All three are things that arrive from elsewhere. The check therefore
// lives where the name is USED, not where a person typed it.
//
// # THE RULE
//
// Segments of [A-Za-z0-9._+-], separated by single slashes, at most
// maxProjectSegments of them. Measured against the 1908 projects of the
// published catalogue: every one fits, nothing uses another character, and
// the deepest is four segments
// (github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test).
//
// An allowlist rather than a denylist of dangerous shapes, because a
// denylist inherits the blind spots of whoever wrote it — `..` is obvious,
// `..%2f` is not, and a percent-encoded separator was already reaching a
// different path in the probe.
