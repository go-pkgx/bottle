// # WHY A TYPE AND NOT A SENTENCE
//
// ⛔ BECAUSE THE PROSE TEST IS TOO WIDE ONCE IT LEAVES THIS PACKAGE.
// repoAbsent's last resort matches `not found` anywhere in an error's text,
// which is safe where it was written — it only ever sees the result of a
// registry call — and wrong as soon as an exported predicate is pointed at
// arbitrary errors. Measured 2026-10-23, the first use of the exported
// IsNotPublished at pkgx's top-level error printer:
//
//	pkgx: command not found in the requested packages: true
//	pkgx: if it should be here: `pkgs request <project>` …
//
// The package was published; the COMMAND was not there. The hint fired on
// the word "not found" in an unrelated sentence.
//
// A type cannot be matched by accident, and it carries the project — so a
// caller can name it instead of printing a placeholder and hoping the
// reader fills it in from the line above.

// exact; the fallback is repoAbsent, whose last resort reads the error's
// TEXT, and text written for another purpose can contain "not found". Pass
// it what came back from the registry, not whatever reached your error

// NoBottleHereError says the project IS published — just not anything this

//
// # WHY A SECOND TYPE, AND WHY IT IS THE COMMON ONE
//
// ⛔ NotPublishedError ALONE COVERED THE RARE HALF. It is returned when the
// repository does not exist at all, which is what a brand-new package looks
// like. The ordinary state is the other one: measured 2026-10-23 against the
// published darwin/aarch64 catalogue, 567 of 1940 projects had a recipe and
// no bottle — 29% of the pantry, against which `pkgx <project>` answered
//
//	no version of aerc-mail.org is published for darwin/aarch64
//	(available: 0.22.0; not published here: 0.22.0)
//
// A good sentence and a dead end: it names no next step, and the hint that
// exists to name one could not fire, because this error was a sentence and
// not a type. Found by RUNNING the shipped binary over a list derived from
// the catalogue — the unit test passed and the mutation was caught, and
// neither could see that the covered case was the rare one.
//
// The fields are the message's own parts, so a caller that wants to say
// something else does not have to parse the sentence back apart.

// Error keeps the two sentences the field reports settled on, verbatim.
//
// ⛔ NO CONSTRAINT MEANS THE CLAUSE IS OMITTED, not printed empty: reported

// for", two spaces where the reason should be, blaming a constraint that did

// one has a registry and an HTTP refusal, the other has versions and a
// platform — but a caller deciding whether to offer `pkgs request` is asking
// the same thing of both. Two predicates at that call site is how one of
// them comes to be forgotten, which is exactly what happened to the second
