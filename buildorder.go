// Ordering the builds of one version.
//
// ⛔⛔ THERE IS NO BUILD DATE, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE PROPERTY RATHER THAN A
// GAP TO FILL. A published bottle's timestamp is PINNED — `bk factory` stamps
// SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, or its own fixed epoch when that is unset, never the
// wall clock — so that re-publishing the same bottle yields byte-identical
// attestations and the same referrer digests. Every bottle the factory
// publishes therefore carries the SAME instant, and sorting by it would order
// a list by a constant while looking like it ordered by time.
//
// Taking the wall clock instead would trade that for an ordering nobody
// needs: it would make every rebuild a new artefact and break the idempotent
// re-push. So the date is not recoverable from a bottle, by construction, and
// a reader asking "which is the newest" has to be answered with something
// that was actually written down.
//
// ⛔ AND ORDER IS A PRESENTATION QUESTION, NOT A RESOLUTION ONE. The resolver
// still refuses an ambiguous version: two builds of one version are siblings,
// and nothing here gives it permission to pick. What this orders is a LIST a
// person reads, and every key below is a recorded fact that the listing names
// out loud — never an inference dressed up as one.
