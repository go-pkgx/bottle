// HCLToYAML turns a package.hcl into the package.yml bytes the rest of this
// package already knows how to read.
//
// It lives here, and not in bk where the HCL front-end was written, because
// the CLIENT has to read these files: the pantry overlay is fetched at install
// time, and a recipe written in HCL is unreadable to a pkgx that cannot parse
// it. bk imports bottle, so the parser cannot live in bk without a cycle — and
// two copies of it would drift.
//
// Converting to YAML rather than decoding straight into a recipe keeps ONE
// parse path: whatever validation and quirk-handling the YAML side has is
// applied to both formats, and a recipe written either way cannot behave
// differently.
//
// Cost, measured before it was added: pkgx goes from 8.81 MB to 9.45 MB.

	// yaml.v3 mangles was wrong, twice.
	//
	// The comment this replaces said the cause was "a string whose first line
	// is indented". Measured against yaml.v3, with no HCL involved:
	//
	//	"    first\nsecond\n"  round-trips fine   ← the stated cause does not fail
	//	"\tfirst\nsecond\n"    cannot be read back
	//	"\nsecond\n"           comes back as "second\n" — one line SHORTER
	//
	// The last is priver.dev/geni's `fixture: |`, which begins with a blank
	// line: the one recipe in 1899 that `bk tohcl` refused. And it is the
	// dangerous shape, because losing a leading blank line is not a parse
	// error — a guard asking only "does it still parse" lets it through.
	//
	// A per-string probe replaced that rule and was ALSO wrong: the same
	// string round-trips at the top of a document and not three levels down,
	// so the outcome depends on nesting depth, which no probe of the string
	// alone can see.
	//
	// So nothing here predicts. The document is marshalled, read back and
	// COMPARED; if it changed, it is marshalled again with every multi-line
	// string double-quoted, a style that carries any string there is. The
	// second pass costs one extra marshal on the rare document that needs it
	// and nothing on the rest, and it is right by construction rather than by
	// a rule that has to be maintained against a library's quirks.

// ran it — a shorter path than the one that was fixed, since it needs
// nothing to be well formed. The name is cleaned at each call site, which
// is where it is known to be untrusted.
//
// Probed afterwards and worth stating: HCL's own parse diagnostics did NOT
// quote raw source in any of twelve crafted inputs. Wrapping them here is
// therefore defence in depth against a future version that does, not a
// reproduced defect — said plainly, because a comment that claims a fix for
// something nobody demonstrated is how an unverified belief becomes
// documentation.
//
// The text goes through the same displayText a summary does: a message is
