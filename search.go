// Searching the catalogue.
//
// # WHY NOT A DESCRIPTION SEARCH
//
// `nix search`, `guix search` and `spack list -s` all match against a
// package's description, and that is the right design for a collection that
// HAS descriptions. This one does not. Measured on the 1907 recipes of the
// pantry this catalogue is built from:
//
//	1592  declare `provides` — the commands they put on PATH
//	   6  carry a `summary` or a `description`
//
// A search over prose would find six packages. So the searchable surface
// here is the COMMAND NAMES, and that turns out to be the question people
// arrive with anyway: you know the command and not the package. `rg` is
// `crates.io/ripgrep`; no amount of guessing at the project name reaches
// it, and a prefix completion on "rg" never will either.
//
// The summary is searched too, because the six cost nothing. It is not what
// makes this useful.

// SearchHit is one result, with the reason it matched.
type SearchHit struct {
	Project string
	// Why names the field that matched, for a reader deciding whether a
	// result is the one they meant: "command", "name" or "summary". An
	// unexplained list of 40 projects is a list nobody reads to the end.
	Why string
	// Match is the matching value — the command name for a command hit, so
	// `rg` appears beside `crates.io/ripgrep` and the reader sees WHY.

//
//	0  a command named exactly this        rg      → crates.io/ripgrep
//	1  a project whose last segment is this jq     → stedolan.github.io/jq

//	3  a project segment containing this   ssl     → openssl.org
//	4  the full project path containing it  gnu    → gnu.org/bash
//	5  the summary containing it
//
// Ties break on the project name, so the same query gives the same order
// every time. A catalogue is a Go map nowhere, but the Projects slice comes
// off a registry and its order is not ours to rely on.
