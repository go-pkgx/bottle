// SpecAnnotation carries a bottle's concrete spec on its per-platform OCI
// manifest, as JSON.
//
// ⛔ THE TAG CARRIES THE ADDRESS, THE ANNOTATION CARRIES THE MEANING. An
// identity hash is opaque by construction, and Nix pays for that: a store
// path says WHICH build and never WHAT build, so answering "the one with
// CUDA?" needs a second index. Spack keeps the spec queryable instead
// (`spack find libdwarf +debug`), and conda writes its hash inputs into
// info/hash_input.json beside the hash.
//
// So readability is a TOOLING property here, not a naming one: the tag stays
// a hash, and this annotation is what `pkgx ls` reads to print `+cuda ~mpi`.
// That is the whole reason the `-glibc<X>` suffix could stop being a second
// spelling of identity.
//
// The key is declared in annotations.go and read through AnnotationPresent(),
// which keeps "absent" distinguishable from "present and empty" — an empty
// spec is a malformed bottle and a missing one is simply an older bottle.

// specJSON is the wire form. Field names are short because an OCI annotation
// value travels in every manifest fetch, and explicit because a Go field
// rename must not silently change what published bottles mean.
// SpecVersion is the payload's format version.
//
// ⛔⛔ A NUMBER, NOT A SCHEMA, AND IT BUYS ONE THING: A LEGIBLE FAILURE.
// Without it, a payload written by a NEWER release is not rejected — it is
// MISREAD. encoding/json drops fields it does not know, silently, so a v2
// spec carrying a new identity-bearing field parses cleanly here as a v1
// spec that happens to lack it.
//
// The bottle is not installed in that case, because VerifySpec recomputes
// the hash and the dropped field moves it. So the outcome is already
// fail-closed — but the message is "the bottle does not match its own
// description", which reads as tampering and sends its reader to look for an
// attacker. The truth is "this bottle was written by a release newer than
// yours", and only a version field can say so.
//
// A JSON Schema would say more and cost more: this value travels in every
// manifest fetch, and a schema is a URL to fetch and a document to keep in
// step for a payload of five fields. The question a reader actually has is
// "can I understand this?", and an integer answers it.
