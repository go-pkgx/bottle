// SpecAnnotation carries a bottle's concrete spec on its per-platform OCI
// manifest, as JSON.
//
// ⛔ THE TAG CARRIES THE ADDRESS, THE ANNOTATION CARRIES THE MEANING. An
// identity hash is opaque by construction, and Nix pays for that: a store
// path says WHICH build and never WHAT build, so answering "the one with
// CUDA?" needs a second index. Spack keeps the spec queryable instead
// (`spack find libdwarf +debug`), and conda writes its hash inputs into
// info/hash_input.json beside the hash.
//
// So readability is a TOOLING property here, not a naming one: the tag stays
// a hash, and this annotation is what `pkgx ls` reads to print `+cuda ~mpi`.
// That is the whole reason the `-glibc<X>` suffix could stop being a second
// spelling of identity.

// value travels in every manifest fetch, and explicit because a Go field
