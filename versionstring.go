// A VERSION OUT OF A LOCK IS UNTRUSTED INPUT, and a lock is fetched from a
// repository and ACTED ON.
//
// # WHAT A CRAFTED VERSION DID
//
// `pkgx --lock` reports an unsatisfiable pin, and the sentence it prints
// ends by naming the demand. Measured, not imagined:
//
//	locked = {
//	  "zlib.net" = { version = "1.3.2\u001b[2K\rzlib.net  1.9.9  ✓ verified", … }
//	}
//
//	$ pkgx --lock esc.lock.hcl true | cat -v
//	pkgx: no version of zlib.net satisfies "=1.3.2\x1b[2K\r…" (available: 2);
//	  asked for by =1.3.2^[[2K^Mzlib.net  1.9.9  ✓ verified (requested)
//
// The first half is %q-quoted and harmless. The second is not, and on a
// terminal `ESC[2K` erases the line and `\r` returns the cursor, so it
// reprints as a different and reassuring one.
//
// This is the same class as the catalogue summary fixed in v0.37.0 — a
// field a third party writes reaching a terminal — through a channel that
// fix did not cover, which is the usual way such a thing comes back.
//
// # REFUSED, NOT STRIPPED, AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE FROM A SUMMARY
//
// A summary is cosmetic, so it is cleaned and shown. A version is a KEY: it
// selects bytes to download and names a directory to put them in. A version
// that is not version-shaped means somebody wanted something, exactness is
// the entire point of a lock, and there is nothing to salvage.
//
// # THE SHAPE WAS MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS GUARDED
//
// Across the two published catalogues of 2026-10-06, 2801 version strings
// use fifteen distinct runes — `0-9`, `.`, and `b e f n` — and the longest
// is 19 bytes (`min.io 2023.10.25.06.33.25`). The allowlist below is wider
// than that on purpose: `+`, `~`, `_` and `-` are ordinary in versions
// elsewhere and refusing them would be a guard written against an attack
// that also refuses the ordinary case.

// ValidateSpecHash refuses a spec that could not be a digest.
//
// # WHY THIS IS LOOSER THAN THE VERSION, DELIBERATELY
//
// A version is a KEY: it picks bytes and names a directory, so it is held
// to a shape. A spec is only ever COMPARED — `bk lock --check` reports it
// moved — and never becomes a path, a URL or an argument. The whole risk it
// carries is that it is printed.
//
// Demanding `sha256:` plus exactly 64 hex digits would add nothing against
// that risk and would refuse locks this project's own tests write with
// short placeholder digests, as well as any future algorithm prefix. A
// guard stricter than its reason is a compatibility break with no security
// to show for it.
//
// Empty is allowed: a lock from a bk that recorded none is still a lock,
// and the fields are compared only when both sides have them.
