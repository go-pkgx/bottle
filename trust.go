// Who may vouch for a build, and how many of them it takes.
//
// # ⛔⛔ TWO PEOPLE BUILDING THE SAME THING PRODUCE THE SAME HASH, ON PURPOSE
//
// The question this answers is "how do I tell a build made by two different
// people apart?", and the first half of the answer is that you do not, and
// must not want to. A build's identity is a function of its inputs; if my
// name went into it, my rebuild of your bottle would get a different address
// and could never be compared with yours. Identity has to collide for two
// independent builds of the same inputs — that collision IS the evidence.
//
// What differs between two builders is therefore not the artefact but the
// ATTESTATION: who put their key on it. So the registry holds one bottle and,
// potentially, several signatures over it, and the client counts them.
//
// # ⛔ WHICH IS WHY ONE PINNED KEY WAS NOT ENOUGH
//
// Until now bottle carried a single SigningPublicKey and oci.go verified the
// FIRST signature referrer it found. With one signer that is correct and with
// two it is not merely incomplete, it is wrong twice over:
//
//   - it cannot count — "signed by both builders" and "signed by one" are the
//     same answer;
//   - it is order-dependent — if the registry lists the other builder's
//     signature first, verification FAILS on a bottle that our own key signed,
//     and the message reads as tampering.
//
// # THE MODEL, AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
//
// A trust SET plus a THRESHOLD, which is TUF's shape (§4.3: a threshold is
// "a positive integer number of keys (>=1) of that role whose signatures are
// required"), with TUF's counting rule (§5.4.2: a client "MUST NOT count more
// than one verified SIGNATURE from that KEYID towards the THRESHOLD").
//
// The spelling of the key list is Nix's `trusted-public-keys` — whitespace
// separated, `name:key` — because an operator who has configured a Nix binary
// cache already knows it. Nix requires one signature from one trusted key;
// Guix likewise checks a single authorised signature on a narinfo, and
// compares servers out of band with `guix challenge`. The threshold is what
// lets that comparison be a precondition of installing rather than an audit
// someone runs afterwards.

	// TrustedKeysEnv REPLACES the trust set. An operator who sets it has
	// said which keys they trust, and silently keeping ours in the list
	// would be deciding that for them.
	TrustedKeysEnv = "ZPKG_TRUSTED_KEYS"
	// ExtraTrustedKeysEnv ADDS to it, which is what almost everyone wants:
	// trust the project plus a colleague. Nix's `extra-` convention, for
	// the reason Nix has it — replacing a default list by hand is how you
	// drop the entry that made everything work.

//
// ⛔ AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE CHOICE, NOT A PLACEHOLDER. The mechanism is
// worth having before a second builder exists, because it has to be in place
// BEFORE the registry is rebuilt — a bottle signed under the old scheme would
// have to be republished to gain a second signature. But shipping a default
// of 2 today would make every published bottle unverifiable by its own client
// the moment this is released, which is not a security improvement, it is an
// outage. Two is one environment variable away, and it becomes the right
// default the day a second builder publishes.

// is there to catch a mistake; the signature list comes from a REGISTRY, so
// its cap is a resource bound against a subject that can be made to carry
// thousands of referrers — each of which would otherwise cost a fetch and a
// signature verification per trusted key.
//
// ⛔ BOTH REFUSE RATHER THAN TRUNCATE. Verifying the first 32 of 5000
