// # WHY A BUILD AND NOT A VERSION
//
// ZPKG_DEPRECATED retires a release LINE, which is the right grain for "3.6 is
// end-of-life". It is the wrong grain for the case this exists for: the
// package is fine, the source is fine, and what is wrong is the TOOLCHAIN it
// was compiled with. A Go patch release fixes a standard-library defect;
// nothing about the recipe or the upstream version changes, only `go.dev` in
// the closure — so the fixed artefact is another build of the SAME version,
// and the broken one has to be nameable without condemning the version.
//
// That is only expressible because a build has an identity. It is the first
// thing the hashed layout buys that a version-addressed store could not do
// at all.
//
// # ⛔⛔ IT RANKS, IT DOES NOT FILTER — THE SAME RULE AS DEPRECATION
//
// A withdrawn build stays resolvable. The reasoning is deprecated.go's and
// has not changed: a LOCK pins a build, and a lock that stops resolving is a
// worse defect than the one being fixed. Reproducibility and an explicit
// request outrank the preference.
//
// So:
//
//   - two builds, one withdrawn → the other, and the withdrawal is announced;
//   - one build, withdrawn      → that one, loudly, because there is nothing
//     else and refusing would strand the caller;
//   - several left after the withdrawn ones are set aside → still AMBIGUOUS.
//     Setting aside a build somebody recorded a reason for is not the same as
//     inventing an order among the rest.
//
// # ⛔ AND IT CARRIES THE REASON AND THE REPLACEMENT
//
// A warning that does not say why is noise, and one that does not say where
// to go next leaves the reader to find the fixed build themselves — which
// means reading hashes, which is the thing nobody can do. `because` is the
// advisory identifier; `superseded_by` is the hash that fixes it, when one
// exists. Empty is honest: a withdrawal with no replacement yet is a real
// state and must be sayable.
//
// Read locally, once, like the deprecation list: the resolver never touches
// the network to choose, because FROM scratch and air-gapped use must keep
// working. Where the file comes from — `bk advisories` and the VEX documents
// attached to published bottles — is a separate matter, the same separation
// as `bk eol` and ZPKG_DEPRECATED.
