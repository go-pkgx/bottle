// A CATALOGUE, because a registry you cannot enumerate cannot be browsed.
//
// # THE MEASUREMENT THAT MADE THIS NECESSARY
//
// An anonymous client can ask ghcr what VERSIONS a project has and cannot ask
// what PROJECTS exist. Measured against ghcr.io/go-pkgx/packages:
//
//	GET /v2/_catalog                               403  (no token issued)
//	GET /v2/go-pkgx/packages/_catalog              403  (no token issued)
//	GET /v2/go-pkgx/packages/zlib.net/tags/list    200  ["1.3.2", …]
//
// The registry API's catalogue endpoint is not served, so `gnu.org/<TAB>`
// has nothing to read. Nix, Guix and Spack all answer this from a LOCAL
// index — a flake/eval cache, a channel checkout, a package repo — and the
// pkgx-native equivalent of a local index is an artefact in the registry
// itself.
//
// # A CATALOGUE IS AN ORDINARY BOTTLE
//
// The same move `members` made for sets: rather than a second kind of
// artefact with its own publishing, signing and mirroring, the catalogue is
// pushed through the path a bottle takes. It is therefore signed, attested,
// cached by the pull-through registry and verified on install by everything
// that already does those things — and a scratch image gets it in ONE pull,
// with no registry API beyond the one it already uses to fetch packages.
