// The annotation keys this project mints, and the ones it still has to read.
//
// ⛔⛔ A REVERSE-DNS KEY IS A CLAIM ON A DOMAIN, AND WE HAD MADE THREE WE
// COULD NOT BACK. The published bottles carry `org.go-pkgx.*`; the rename
// turned that into `org.go-zpkg.*`. Neither is ours: `go-pkgx.org` and
// `go-zpkg.org` are domains nobody here has ever registered. It is the same
// error as `go-pkgx.dev/catalog` and as `application/vnd.pkgx.*` — a name
// that looks like ours because we are the only ones using it.
//
// `io.github.go-zpkg` is the reverse-DNS of a host we demonstrably control:
// go-zpkg.github.io answers, and the Pages repository exists. It is the same
// convention OCI itself uses (`org.opencontainers.image.*`) applied honestly.
//
// ⛔ WRITE ONE, READ THREE. Nothing rewrites a published manifest, and
// 42 756 bottles carry `org.go-pkgx.*`. A reader that accepted only the new
// key would not fail loudly — it would find the annotation ABSENT, and every
// one of these keys means something different when absent: no glibc flavour,
// no declared sonames, no recorded spec. Silence is the worst possible
// failure for exactly these fields, so the legacy keys stay readable until
// nothing in the registry carries them.
