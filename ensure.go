// publishers race on. Nothing about the bottle itself says so; only the index
// does, which is why this takes the descriptor the push returned rather than
// trying to discover it. Discovery would go through the very index in question.

// publisher dropped it, and reports whether it had to.
//
// The per-push reconcile in mergePlatformIntoIndex confirms its write twice with
// a settle window between, which catches a racer landing just behind it. It
// cannot catch one that lands later still — after this publisher has moved on to
// the next package, or exited. This is the pass for that: run it once the whole
// batch is done, when the other publishers have finished too and a repair
// sticks.
//
// Re-merging (rather than re-writing) is what keeps the repair safe: it starts
// from the index as it now stands, so a platform some other publisher added in
// the meantime survives.
