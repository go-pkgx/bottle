// "Available" is a claim about ONE registry.

// VersionsFor answers a resolver's question — "what version satisfies this
// constraint" — and for that, a list borrowed from the upstream dist is a
// fine answer, because the install still pulls from DistBase and either
// list resolves the same constraint.
//
// A CATALOGUE asks a different question with the same words. `pkgx ls
// doxygen.nl` showing "1.14.0" means "you can have this"; if that number
// came from dist.pkgx.dev while our registry has never published the
// project, the next command fails. The catalogue was about to be built on
// exactly that answer.
//
// So the flag is the test: the SAME call, two registries, two verdicts.
