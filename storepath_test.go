// composed inline at nine call sites. Two bottles of one version that differ
// only in build options resolve to the same directory, so the second install
// meets the first and renameOrExplain refuses:
//
//	already holds other content … the bottle carries v3.3.11
//
// Correct behaviour on a wrong layout. The fix is not to relax the refusal —
// it is the only thing standing between a user and a silently replaced
// prefix — but to give the two builds different addresses.
