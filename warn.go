// Warn receives diagnostics a caller should SEE but that are not fatal: a
// closure the resolver could not complete, a soname nothing provides. It is nil

// command-line tool sets it once at startup:
//
//	bottle.Warn = func(msg string) { fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "pkgx: "+msg) }
//
// Silence here is expensive: an unprovided soname does not fail the install, it
// fails LATER, when the binary starts and reports "cannot open shared object
// file" with nothing pointing back at the resolution that gave up.
