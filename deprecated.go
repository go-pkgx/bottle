// DeprecatedEnv names a JSON file that lists, per project, release lines that
// are end-of-life:
//
//	{"openssl.org": ["3.6", "3.4", "1.1.1"]}
//
// ⛔ THIS IS A PREFERENCE, NOT A CONSTRAINT. A deprecated version stays
// resolvable: it is RANKED LAST among the versions that satisfy a constraint,
// never removed from the list. The two shapes behave the same on every request
// except one, and that one is the whole correctness question:
//
//	^3.6.4  admits ONLY 3.6.4, which is deprecated.
//
// A RANK resolves it to 3.6.4 (and warns). A FILTER would leave nothing and
// fail the request. This is RANK, on purpose: reproducibility and an explicit
// request for a dead line outrank the preference, and a lock that stopped
// resolving would be a worse defect than the one this fixes.
//
// It follows that the preference only changes an answer where a supported
// candidate ALSO satisfies the constraint. `=3.6.4` and `^3.6.4` have none, so
// they get 3.6.4; `^3` and `^3.5` have 3.5.x, so they get 3.5.8; `^4` and `^3`
// share no satisfier, so the preference can never reach across a soname
// boundary. No special case for exact pins is needed or present.
//
// The file is read locally, once. The resolver never touches the network to
// choose a version (FROM scratch and air-gapped use must keep working). Where
// the list comes from — `bk eol` computing it from endoflife.date — is a
// separate matter. An unset variable, a missing file or an unreadable one all
// mean an empty list, i.e. exactly the behaviour without this feature; an
// unparsable file is reported once on stderr and also means an empty list.
const DeprecatedEnv = "PKGX_DEPRECATED"

// DefaultDeprecated is the list used when DeprecatedEnv is unset.
//
// ⛔ IT EXISTS BECAUSE AN OPT-IN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE FIXES NOTHING. Shipped
// with the variable as the only source, this whole feature changed no answer
// for anybody: openssl's 3.6 line went end-of-life on 2026-11-01 and `^3` went
// on resolving to 3.6.4 across the fleet, because nothing set the variable.
// A capability nobody switches on is a capability the fleet does not have.
//
// So a binary may carry a default, and `pkgx` does. The precedence is
// deliberate and the surprising direction is the one to avoid:
//
//   - DeprecatedEnv set and readable → that file, and ONLY that file;
//   - DeprecatedEnv set and broken   → empty, with a warning. It does NOT fall
//     back to this default: an operator who named a file has said what they
//     want, and quietly substituting something else would hide their mistake
//     behind working behaviour;
//   - DeprecatedEnv unset            → this default.
//
// A caller sets it before the first resolution. The list is latched once, so
// setting it afterwards does nothing — which is why `pkgx` does it in main
// rather than lazily.
