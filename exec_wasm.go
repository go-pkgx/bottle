// already running.
//
// So Exec fails, loudly and early, instead of being absent. Everything else in
// this package — resolving versions, pulling bottles, verifying signatures,
// extracting into a store — has no such obstacle and works unchanged; only the
// "become the target program" step has no meaning here. A wasm host runs a
// module it fetched, it does not hand its own identity over to it.
