// What the bottle store HOLDS — the one tree nothing in this family could
// show.
//
// # WHY IT WAS WORTH WRITING
//
// Every ephemeral `pkgx <pkg>` leaves its bottles in
// $PKGX_DIR/<project>/v<version>, and nothing ever removes one. `pkgm list`
// lists INSTALLATIONS, which is a different set: it answers "what did I ask
// for", not "what is on this disk".
//
// Measured on this developer's machine before any of this existed: 42 GB
// across 332 versions, 14.1 GB of it llvm.org alone, with three full
// versions of it present. Nobody chose that; nothing could have told them.
//
// # LISTING IS NOT COLLECTING, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE
//
// nix, guix and spack all separate the two — `nix path-info -S` against
// `nix store gc`, `guix gc --list-live` against `guix gc`, `spack find`
// against `spack gc` — and all three make the ROOTS explicit before
// deleting anything. There is no profile here, so there is no root set, and
// a version that looks superseded may be exactly what a lock pins or what
// an environment asks for.
//
// So this reports and deletes nothing. "Older than another version here" is
// a fact about the disk; "garbage" would be a claim about intent, and the
// claim needs roots this package does not have.

// StoreEntry is one version directory and what it occupies.

// ScanStore reports every version directory under a bottle store.

// Symlinks are counted NEVER: writeVersionLinks puts `v*`, `v22` and

// report llvm.org four times and the store at several times its size. The

// LIVE AND DEAD, against roots the caller names.
//
// # WHY A LOCK IS THE ROOT, AND WHY THAT MAKES THIS EXACT
//
// guix's rule is the one to copy: "any file under /gnu/store reachable from
// a root is considered live and cannot be deleted; any other file is
// considered dead". The roots are explicit — symlinks under
// /var/guix/gcroots, the user's profiles — and `guix gc --list-live`
// reports before `guix gc` removes.
//
// There is no profile here, which is why ScanStore reports and nothing
// deletes. But a LOCK is a root set already: it pins every project in the
// closure, not only the roots the person typed, which is the whole reason
// `pkgx --lock` exists. So reachability needs no graph walk and no network
// — membership in the lock IS the closure.
//
// An ENVIRONMENT would not do: it names constraints, which have to be
// resolved against the registry, and that is a network call this cannot
// make. Saying which of the two is usable here is better than offering both
// and failing on one.
//
// # IT STILL DELETES NOTHING, AND THE WORDING SAYS WHOSE ROOTS
//
// "Dead" here means "not reachable from the roots you named" — not
// "garbage". Name a different lock and a different half of the store is
// dead. The caller holds that judgement, and the report has to hand it back
// rather than imply the store has an opinion.
