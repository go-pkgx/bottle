// ELFNeeded is what an ELF file loads: its DT_NEEDED entries.
//
// It is the linux counterpart of MachoNeeded, and the two answer differently
// shaped questions. A Mach-O names a PATH, so "is it satisfied" is a stat. An
// ELF names a SONAME and the loader searches for it, so the question is
// whether ANYTHING in the closure provides that name — which is a comparison
// against the whole store, not against one path.
//
// Both readers live here because an audit that runs on one platform and not
// the other measures half a fleet. This one is exported for `bk unresolved`;
// CompleteClosure has used the same reading to repair a closure for a while.

// map, so a closure that has not run that step yet looks short of them without
// being wrong. The host-provided ones are a boundary rather than a gap: a GPU
// driver's userspace half is versioned in lockstep with a kernel module and
