// DEAD END. It says, correctly:
//
//	fftw.org 3.3.11 was published as 2 different builds (…) and nothing here
//	says which: a variant hash is not a version, so there is no newest one
//	to pick
//
// A refusal that cannot be answered is only half a design. These are the two
// halves it was missing: ask WHICH builds exist, and say which one you mean.

// Build is one build of one version: what distinguishes it, and where it is.

	// them hand the reader the problem the command was asked to solve; see

// a hash", justified by the claim that a pantry component would contain a
// letter outside base32's alphabet or be longer than a hash. That claim is

// covers very nearly every lowercase word. `x.org/pciaccess`,
// `gnome.org/libxml2`, `wpewebkit.org/libwpe` and `github.com/gabime/spdlog`
