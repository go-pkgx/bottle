// ⛔ "NOT PUBLISHED HERE" AND "I COULD NOT ASK" ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS, and
// ghcr spells the first one as 403 at the token endpoint for a repository
// that does not exist. A user met that raw:
//
//	pkgx: … is not published in ghcr.io/go-pkgx/packages/… :
//	      response status code 403: denied: requested access to the
//	      resource is denied
//
// which reads as a credentials problem and is not one.
//
// Exported so a caller outside this package can tell them apart; this test
// pins the mapping, including the one that must NOT be an absence.
// ⛔ THE FALSE POSITIVE THAT MADE THIS A TYPE. repoAbsent's last resort
// matches "not found" anywhere in the text, which is safe where it was
// written — it only ever sees the result of a registry call — and wrong
// the moment an exported predicate is pointed at arbitrary errors.
// Measured 2026-10-23 at pkgx's top-level error printer:
//
//	pkgx: command not found in the requested packages: true
//	pkgx: if it should be here: `pkgs request <project>` …
//
// The package was published; the COMMAND was missing. A type cannot be
// matched by accident, and it carries the project so a caller can name it.
