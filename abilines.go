// pickABILines answers the demands on a project with SEVERAL versions, when no
// one version can meet them all and it is provably safe to hold both.
//
// This is what a resolver that only intersects cannot do. open-mpi.org does not
// resolve today for exactly one reason:
//
//	no version of gnome.org/libxml2 satisfies ">=2.14" AND "~2.13";
//	  asked for by >=2.14 (open-mpi.org/hwloc), ~2.13 (gnu.org/gettext)
//
// Both demands are correct. libxml2 broke its ABI inside major 2 — 2.13.9 ships
// libxml2.2.dylib and 2.15.4 ships libxml2.16.dylib — so hwloc and gettext are
// not arguing about a version, they are describing two different libraries that
// happen to share a name. Spack calls the same policy `unify: when_possible`.
//
// SAFE means one thing, and it is measured rather than assumed: the chosen
// versions must ship DISJOINT sonames. Then no binary can bind to the wrong
// one — each records the soname it was linked against, Mach-O through its ABI
// line and ELF through the soname itself — and nothing is interposed. Two
// versions that ship the SAME soname are a genuine conflict and stay refused,
// because whichever the loader reached first would silently be wrong.
//
// A version whose bottle declares no sonames at all is treated as unknown, not
// as empty: it is skipped and the refusal stands. Guessing here would produce
// exactly the failure the whole mechanism exists to prevent.
//
// What this does NOT settle is the profile collision Guix refuses: both
// versions put a bin directory on PATH, and two xmllint cannot both be first.
// The newest line leads, deterministically, because the versions are returned
// newest-first — the same order `v*` already means.
