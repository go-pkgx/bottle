// fetchBottle goes through OCIClient.repository, which validates the name, so
// a `..` failed at the fetch. But the os.Stat that decides "already present"
// runs BEFORE that fetch. For a project of `../..` naming a directory that
// exists, InstallFor returned (false, nil) — which its own contract reads as
// "the bottle is already installed". The caller is told the work is done,
// nothing was installed, and the evidence was a directory outside the store.
//
// Resolved is an exported struct with exported fields: a caller can fill it
// without going through a resolver or a catalogue, both of which validate.
