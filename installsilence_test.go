// ⛔⛔ "ALREADY INSTALLED" MUST MEAN THE REQUESTED PREFIX IS THERE.
//
// InstallFor renames the unpacked tree onto `dest`, the directory the BOTTLE
// carries — which is not always the version that was requested. A rebuild is
// published as `3.3.11_1` and still unpacks to `v3.3.11`.
//
// So installing a rebuild into a store that already held `v3.3.11` renamed
// onto an occupied directory, took the concurrent-install branch, and
// returned (false, nil): "already installed". Nothing was installed. The
// caller then ran a binary under a prefix that had never been created and
// got a bare "no such file or directory" — go-zpkg/bk#386, found on the
// first real use of the rebuild counter.
//
// Measured before the fix, against the published fftw.org 3.3.11_1:
//
//	Install         -> fresh=false err=<nil>
//	stat(v3.3.11_1) -> no such file or directory
//
// ⛔⛔ THE AMBIGUITY IS NOW UNCONSTRUCTIBLE, AND THIS TESTS THAT RATHER THAN
// THE OLD BRANCH. renameOrExplain used to TAKE `dest` from its caller, which
// is how `dest` came to be the archive's directory and could disagree with
// what was asked for. It now computes `dest` from the requested version and
// the build's hash, so there is no wrong destination left to detect — the
// property to check is that a rebuild and its base end up in DIFFERENT
// directories, with neither overwriting the other.
//
// Driven through the real install, not through the helper: a test of a
// helper's contract proves nothing once the contract has moved, and the
// defect bk#386 describes is about what ends up on disk.
