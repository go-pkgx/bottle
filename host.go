// Package bottle is the reusable pkgx "bottle backend": it resolves a package's
// runtime dependency closure from the pkgx pantry, downloads the bottles from
// the configured PKGX_DIST (default: the signed oci://ghcr.io/go-pkgx/packages
// registry; PKGX_DIST=https://dist.pkgx.dev for the unsigned upstream), and
// installs them — with no runtime dependencies of its own (pure Go,
// CGO_ENABLED=0, runnable on a `FROM scratch` image). It is imported by the
// pkgm CLI and by sibling tools so there is one source of truth.

// osSlug maps a Go GOOS value to the pkgx OS slug. Everything that is not
// named here is treated as linux (pkgx bottles those three families, and an
// exotic unix is closer to linux than to nothing). It is a pure function so
// every branch is unit-testable without needing to be built for that OS.
//
// js and wasip1 are named because the linux default is WRONG for them, not
// merely approximate. This package compiles and passes for both, so it runs in
// a browser and under a WASI runtime — and there it used to report
//
//	HostSlug() = "linux" / "wasm"
//
// a platform that does not exist and never will. A consumer asking the registry
// for linux/wasm bottles gets nothing, forever, with no hint as to why. They
// stay distinct from each other too: a WASI guest and a browser are different
// hosts (different imports, different capabilities), so a module built for one
// is not a bottle for the other.
// osSlug maps Go's GOOS onto the OS name pkgx uses for a platform.
//
// The BSDs are named explicitly because the fallback below is the dangerous
// kind of default: it does not refuse, it ANSWERS, and the answer was "linux".
// A FreeBSD or OpenBSD host running this therefore called itself linux and
// resolved linux bottles — ELF files it cannot load, discovered at the first
// exec rather than at the resolution that chose them. Nothing said no.
//
// Naming them turns that into "no bottle for <project> (freebsd/aarch64)",
// which is true, actionable, and arrives before anything is installed. There
// are no freebsd bottles yet; saying so is the point.
//
// What still falls through is honest to state rather than paper over: android
// is linux-like and the fallback suits it, while illumos, solaris, aix and
// plan9 would be answered wrongly in the same silent way. They are not targets
// today, and widening the list for a platform with no witness is how a guess
// gets mistaken for support.
