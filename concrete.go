// A CONCRETE SPEC IS WHAT A BOTTLE IS.
//
// # The question this answers
//
// Two bottles of the same version, compiled with different options, were
// indistinguishable: the identity of a bottle was
//
//	<project> : <version>[_N][-glibc<X>]  ×  <os>/<arch>
//
// and nothing in it names a build option. `openmpi+cuda` and `openmpi~cuda`
// could not coexist — the only way to publish both was the `_N` rebuild
// counter, which is an ORDER ("the newer replaces the older"), not a choice.
// In an HPC pantry that is the difference between expressing a dependency and
// hoping for one.
//
// # Why a hash, and why over everything
//
// Spack is the precedent, including its false starts: it carried THREE hashes
// — dag_hash, build_hash and full_hash — and in 2022 collapsed them into one
// dag_hash covering build, link and run dependencies plus the hash of the
// package file itself. The project that lived this tension longest tried the
// split and came back from it.
//
// # ⛔⛔ A CONCRETE SPEC IS NOT A REQUEST
//
// The first version of this type used one map for both, and that was the
// design error. Spack keeps them apart and must: `fabrics=verbs,ofi` means
// AT LEAST those, `fabrics:=verbs,ofi` means EXACTLY those, and `++debug`
// propagates to dependents. All three describe how to CHOOSE a build. None of
// them describes a build — once concretised, a node has one definite set of
// values, and the question "was this asked for exactly or at least?" has no
// answer here because it was already answered.
//
// So: VariantConstraints are what a user writes (see ParseConstraints), and
// Variants are what a bottle has. Mixing them would put a question into an
// identity, and two bottles reached by different questions would hash apart
// while being the same bytes.
//
// # glibc is not a special case
//
// It used to be one: a `-glibc<X>` tag suffix with its own splitter, its own
// branch in selectVersions and its own host-derived selector. It is a
// DEPENDENCY whose version changes the ABI, so it belongs in Deps like any
// other, and the readable suffix was a second spelling of identity — the exact
// shape of defect that let numericKey drop a published version three times
// over (see its comment).
//
// Readability is served by the annotation and the local catalogue, which is
// where `spack find -l` serves it too. The tag carries the address.
type Concrete struct {
	// Platform is "<os>/<arch>", eg. "linux/x86-64".
	//
	// ⛔ IN THE HASH, because reuse across operating systems is otherwise
	// silently wrong. Spack carries an `os_compatible` map and it is
	// DIRECTIONAL — sonoma may reuse monterey's builds and not the reverse —
	// which is only expressible if the identity says which one it is. An
	// identity that omitted the platform would let a darwin bottle answer a
	// linux pin, and the error would surface as a missing symbol.
	Platform string

	// Variants are the build options this bottle WAS BUILT WITH: definite,
	// possibly multi-valued, never a constraint. A boolean is ["true"] or
	// ["false"].
	Variants Variants

	// Deps is the resolved closure: every project this build was made
	// against, at the exact version and hash it was made against. glibc is
	// one of these.
	Deps []Dep

	// Recipe is the digest of the build PLAN the recipe produced — never of
	// the recipe file's bytes.
	//
	// ⛔ CANONICALISED, AND THE DISTINCTION IS THE WHOLE VALUE. Nix hashes the
	// derivation — the instantiated plan — not the expression that produced
	// it, and Spack's package_hash strips comments and docstrings from
	// package.py before hashing. Digesting the file's bytes instead would
	// make a reflowed comment rebuild the world: every dependent's hash
	// changes, every bottle is republished, and nothing about any binary
	// differs. That is not a conservative choice, it is a wrong one — it
	// spends the fleet's whole build capacity on whitespace.
	//
	// So the producer owes this field a digest over the RESOLVED build: the
	// script after substitution, the environment, the flags. bk computes it;
	// bottle only carries it, and states the contract here because a field
	// that merely says "digest" invites the cheap, wrong answer.
	Recipe string

	// Graft, when set, is the hash of the spec this bottle was produced from
	// by rewriting references rather than by building.
	//
	// ⛔⛔ THE FIELD EXISTS NOW BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE ADDED LATER. A full-closure
	// identity means a CVE fix in a leaf changes the hash of every dependent,
	// so shipping one would rebuild and re-download the world. Guix's answer
	// is not to weaken the hash: it patches store references in the already
	// built output — "grafting works by patching files, including binary
	// files, directly" — in "time proportional to the size of the package,
	// usually less than a minute", and the result is a NEW store item while
	// the original stays reachable (`guix build bash --no-grafts`).
	//
	// That only works if a grafted bottle has an identity of its own, which
	// means this field is in the canonical form. Adding it after the first
	// bottle is published would change every hash already issued.
	//
	// Guix's restrictions come with it and are not ours to relax: the
	// replaced and replacing name+version must be the SAME LENGTH (the patch
	// is in-place in binaries), and a shared library's replacement must keep
	// the same SONAME and be binary-compatible. The layer that performs
	// grafts enforces those; this field only records that one happened.
	Graft string
}

// Dep is one resolved edge of a closure: a project at a version, and the hash
// of the concrete spec that version was itself built from.
//
// The hash is part of the edge, not a lookup: depending on "openssl.org 3.6.4"
// is ambiguous once openssl itself has variants, and an identity built from
// the ambiguous half would collide exactly where it matters.

// Variants are the definite build options of a built bottle: name to its

type Variants map[string][]string

// canonSep separates fields inside one canonical line.
//
// ⛔⛔ IT IS NOT WHAT MAKES THE FORM UNAMBIGUOUS — the length prefix is. An
// earlier version separated a variant's values with a second reserved byte
// and relied on ParseConstraints to refuse it in a value, and the test caught
// the hole immediately: a Concrete can be built straight from a registry
// annotation, which never passes through that parser, and then
//
//	{"x": ["a", "b"]}   and   {"x": ["a\x01b"]}
//
// render to the same bytes and so to the same hash. A validator guards the
// door it stands at; an encoding has to be injective wherever the value came
// from, because the attacker supplies the annotation.
const canonSep = "\x00"

// Canonical renders the spec as the exact bytes that are hashed.
//
// ⛔ EVERY FIELD IS SORTED AND DELIMITED. A canonical form that depended on map
// order would give one build two identities, and one built by concatenation
// without a delimiter would give two builds one: {"ab","c"} and {"a","bc"}
// hash alike the moment the separator is "". Both are tested.
//
// ⛔ AND THE INSTALL PREFIX IS NOT IN IT. $PKGX_DIR is where a bottle lands,
// not what it is. Nix states the consequence of getting this wrong: "One
// cannot copy a store object to a store with a different store directory",
// and a cache stops being shareable the moment identity depends on where the
// reader keeps it. Our having no fixed prefix is only an advantage while the
