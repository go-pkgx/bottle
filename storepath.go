// The store's layout, in one place.
//
// ⛔⛔ A PATH KEYED ON THE VERSION ALONE CANNOT HOLD TWO BUILDS OF ONE VERSION,
// AND THAT IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM THIS FILE EXISTS FOR.
//
// Measured before writing it: the convention `<dir>/<project>/v<version>` was
// spelled out at NINE call sites — install.go:131, 240, 241, 271, 357,
// closure.go:278, 532, pkgx.go:2057, 2155 — and read back at none. Two bottles
// that differ only in their build options resolve to the same directory, so
// installing the second one meets the first and the installer refuses:
//
//	already holds other content … the bottle carries v3.3.11
//
// That refusal is correct behaviour on a wrong layout. `+cuda` and `~cuda`
// are not a sequence, there is no newer one, and nothing in the path says
// which of them is on disk.
//
// So the directory carries the concrete spec's hash when there IS one:
//
//	<dir>/<project>/v3.3.11                      identity not recorded
//	<dir>/<project>/v3.3.11-habcdefghij012345    THIS build of 3.3.11
//
// The bare form is not a default and not a fallback for a hash we could have
// computed. It is the honest statement that a bottle arrived without a spec
// annotation — a mirrored bottle, or one built before bk published one — and
// that nothing on disk can say which build it is. Minting a hash for it would
// put a claim in the path that no witness supports.
//
// ⛔ THE SEPARATOR IS SHARED WITH THE REGISTRY TAG ON PURPOSE. variantSep is
// what `bk` writes into the tag and what SplitVariantHash reads back out, so
// a directory name and a tag suffix cannot drift apart into two spellings of
// one idea. The round trip is asserted, not assumed.

// StorePrefix returns the directory a bottle occupies in a store.
//
// It is the ONLY place that composes one. Nine inline spellings is nine
// chances for one of them to forget the variant hash, and a path that forgets
// it silently addresses somebody else's build.
// ⛔⛔ IT RESOLVES FIRST, AND THAT IS WHAT KEEPS EVERY CALLER CORRECT. Since
// every installed directory carries a hash, `<dir>/<project>/v<version>` is
// no longer a path that exists in a store; six read sites compute it and
// would all have to learn to ask. They ask through here instead.
//
// When nothing is installed — or when several builds are and the request
// does not say which — it falls back to the COMPOSED path, which is the
// same string those callers got before anything was installed. Their
// "not installed" branch is a failing os.Stat either way, so none of them
// changes behaviour; what changes is that an installed build is now found
// under its hash.

}

// StoreDirName is the single directory component under the project — the
// ALIAS when there is no recorded variant, because that is what a reader
// computes from (project, version) alone.
//
// ⛔ THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE REAL DIRECTORY. Since every install is written to
// a hashed directory (see StoreBuildDirName), a bare `v<version>` here names
// a SYMLINK to one. Readers follow it; the installer never writes it as a
// directory.
func StoreDirName(v Ver) string {
	name := "v" + v.Raw
	if v.Variant != "" {
		name += variantSep + v.Variant
	}
	return name
}

// StoreBuildDirName is the REAL directory a build occupies: always hashed.
//
// ⛔⛔ EVERY INSTALLED TREE CARRIES ITS HASH, WITH NO EXCEPTION. A layout with
// two shapes — `v3.3.11` here and `v3.3.11-h…` there — is one a reader has to
// branch on, and the branch is where two builds of one version silently
// become one. The alias `v3.3.11` still exists, as a SYMLINK, so nothing that
// computes a path from (project, version) has to change; what it points at
// names which build it is.
//
// The hash comes from the strongest witness available, in this order:
//
//	the tag's variant hash   the concrete spec: platform, declared variants,
//	                         resolved closure, recipe plan. What `bk` published.
//	the content digest       the bottle's own manifest digest. Says "these
//	                         exact bytes" and nothing about why.
//	the source               neither is available: an unverified HTTP dist,
//	                         which by construction offers no digest to trust.
//
// ⛔ THE THIRD IS NAMED AND NOT HIDDEN. It hashes where the bytes were asked
// for, not what came back, so it does NOT distinguish two different builds
// served from one URL. That is the honest limit of an unsigned dist —
// ZPKG_VERIFY already has to be off to reach it — and giving it the same
// shape as the others keeps the layout uniform without pretending the
// guarantee is the same.

// installer has to find the matching directory. If each shortened in its own
// way the two would silently address different things, and the symptom would

// the one thing in it that is not, and the whole store is routinely mounted
// somewhere else (an NFS export, a container rootfs, a staged builder).
//

// LinkView materialises the `v<version>` alias for ONE build inside a VIEW —
// a user's profile, an environment, or a container rootfs being assembled.
//
// ⛔⛔ A DEFAULT IS NOT A PROPERTY OF THE STORE, AND AN HPC SITE IS WHERE THAT
// STOPS BEING A NICETY. The store is a shared NFS export: one copy of each
// build, read by everyone, writable by few. An alias written INTO it would
// make one user's choice of default everyone's, and would need write access
// to a tree that is often mounted read-only. The first version of this wrote
// the alias into the store, and that is the bug.
//
// So the store holds hashed directories and nothing else — no mutable state,
// no selection, safe to share and safe to freeze. "Which build do I get when
// I do not say" is answered by a VIEW, and a view is built for a context:
//
//	a user's default      their own state directory
//	an environment        resolved to exact hashes when it is loaded, so it
//	                      never consults a default at all
//	a container/microVM   the links are COMPUTED INTO THE IMAGE at creation
//	                      time from the shared store, which is why they must
//	                      not be in the store to begin with
//
// That is Nix's profiles and Spack's views, and the reason both keep the
// store immutable.
//
// ⛔ THE TARGET IS ABSOLUTE HERE, UNLIKE AN IN-STORE LINK. A view normally
// sits on a different filesystem from the store — a home directory beside an
// NFS export, an image being staged under a build root — so a relative
// target would resolve against the view and find nothing. A view is a
// projection of one particular store; it is not itself relocatable, and
// pretending otherwise would produce links that are silently dangling.

//	                          says so rather than picking one
//
// ⛔ SEVERAL IS NOT "TAKE THE NEWEST". Two builds of one version are siblings
// — that is the whole reason they both exist — and there is no order between
