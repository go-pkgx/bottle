// Measured on the published registry, 2026-10-22: nodejs.org 26.8.1 has no
// linux/x86-64 bottle and 26.8.0 does. `publishedTagFor` walks these
// spellings and asks the registry about each, so with "26.8.0" in the list
// for 26.8.1 it got a hit on a DIFFERENT RELEASE and answered yes. `bk
// catalog` then recorded 26.8.1 as the version linux/x86-64 carries, the
// published catalogue advertised a node nobody could install, and the
// 26.8.0 that platform does have became unreachable — `pkgs ls nodejs.org`
// named one version and it was the wrong one.
//
// The same function answers "is this lock's pin published", where a yes
// about a neighbouring version is worse still: a lock exists to say that
// nothing moved.

// ⛔ WHAT THIS FIX DOES *NOT* COVER, recorded because finding it and saying
// nothing is how the next person re-discovers it.

// The rule above is about dropping NUMERIC components. Two shapes drop

// is a decision rather than an accident:
//
//	1.1.1w          → also offers "1.1.1"
//	1.0.0+glibc2.28 → parses to Nums [1 0 0 28], Tag "", and offers "1.0.0.28"
//
// ⛔ The first is the same class as the defect fixed above: openssl 1.1.1
// and 1.1.1w are different releases, so a probe for one that hits the other
// would answer about the wrong software. It is NOT fixed here because
// nothing was measured breaking because of it — this registry carries no
// openssl 1.x at all — and inventing a fix for an unmeasured defect is how
// an audit fabricates them. It is written down instead.
//
// The second shows the `v.Tag != ""` guard in tagSpellings never fires for
// a version that came through ParseVer, which puts the flavour in Nums.
