// ⛔⛔ A REBUILD IS NOT A SPELLING OF THE VERSION IT REBUILDS.
//
// tagSpellings exists because `1.2` and `1.2.0` are one release written two
// ways, and it already refuses to drop a NON-ZERO component — "26.8.1" must
// never suggest "26.8.0", because that is a different release and answering
// about it made `pkgs ls` advertise a node nobody could install.
//
// It built those alternatives from v.Nums alone, and the rebuild counter is
// not in v.Nums. So for `3.3.11_1` it emitted:
//
//	3.3.11_1, 3.3.11, 3.3.11.0
//
// and `3.3.11` is the bottle WITHOUT the rebuild — a different build of the
// same sources, which is the whole reason the counter exists. PublishedTagFor
// walks these and asks the registry about each, so a lock pinning the rebuilt
// bottle would have been told "published" on finding the un-rebuilt one, and
// `bk catalog` would have advertised a rebuild that does not exist.
//
// That is the same defect rebuild_test.go was written about — "a lock pinning
// the REBUILT bottle would therefore have installed the un-rebuilt one, the
// vulnerable one, and said nothing" — arriving by a second route after the
// comparator was fixed against the first.
